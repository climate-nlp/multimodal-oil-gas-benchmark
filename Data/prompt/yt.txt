As an expert annotator, please annotate "narratives" of advertising videos from the oil & gas (O&G) sector companies.

First, you must watch the video carefully (video frames and transcript (if available) will be given). Second, answer the labels based on the criteria if an audience will be impressed implicitly or explicitly by the video. You can select multiple labels. Video ad messages are aimed at a diverse range of people, and they usually convey a corporate impression without requiring deep thought. Therefore, when labeling, please try to consider implicit messages and follow your gut feeling after watching the video. Some labels may overlap, so please label all relevant labels.
